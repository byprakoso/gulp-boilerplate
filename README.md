# gulp-boilerplate
This repo contain the files that I use when creating static web project

## How to Use

### 1. Install Node JS & NPM
Install Node JS and NPM from this link: https://nodejs.org/en (Recommend use LTS version)


### 2. Check Node JS & NPM version
Check if the Node JS and NPM already installed. You can use these two command in cmd/terminal
 
```
node --v
```

```
npm --v
```


### 3. Install NPM Packages
Install all NPM's packages that required for this boilerplate. This will generate node-modules folder and npm package files

```
node install
```

### 4. Run Gulp
If you have install all the NPM's packages, this boiler plate ready to serve and you can use it to develop your own project here
```
gulp
```
